      Version 2.0 and later of MvvmQuickCross will be published in this package under the name QuickCross. This version will add iOS data binding support. Versions prior to 2.0 will be supported at the existing repository and the existing MvvmQuickCross NuGet packages will remain available.
      
      Note: This version (1.6) of QuickCross is not fully functional; you should not upgrade from MvvmQuickCross to QuickCross until version 2.0 is published.

      Upgrading existing applications to version 2.0 will be quick (pun intended); simply uninstall MvvmQuickCross, install QuickCross, and replace "MvvmQuickCross" with "MvvmCross" in your source code.QuickCross is a lightweight (no binaries) cross-platform MVVM pattern to quickly build native Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, Windows Phone and Windows Store Apps with shared C# code.

      QuickCross provides data binding for Android (and for iOS soon). It accelerates development with scaffolders and code snippets, also for a single platform app. For cross-platform apps QuickCross increases code sharing with an Application-Navigator pattern.

      QuickCross aims to leave you in full control; it does not get in the way if you want to do some things differently, and you can simply extend or modify it.

      See the project site on GitHub for news, example apps and full reference documentation.
