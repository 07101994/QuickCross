Version 2.0 and later of [MvvmQuickCross](https://github.com/MacawNL/MvvmQuickCross) will be published here under the name **QuickCross**. This version will add iOS data binding support. Versions prior to 2.0 will be supported at the existing repository and [the existing MvvmQuickCross NuGet packages](http://nuget.org/packages/mvvmquickcross) will remain available.Upgrading existing applications to version 2.0 will be **quick** (pun intended); simply uninstall MvvmQuickCross, install QuickCross, and replace "MvvmQuickCross" with "QuickCross" in your source code.## News ##**Coming up**: Next planned QuickCross release: 2.0, which will add simple iOS data binding and an iOS example app.
