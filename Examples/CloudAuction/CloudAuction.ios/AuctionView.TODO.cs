/* TODO: To complete adding the Auction storyboard view, follow these steps:
 *
 * 1 From Xamarin Studio, open the storyboard file to which you want to add the view.
 * 2 XCode will now open. In XCode, add your view to the storyboard.
 * 3 Set the Class name and the Storyboard ID for the controller to AuctionView 
 *   (it is recommended to also check 'Use Storyboard ID' so you will use the same name for the Restoration ID).
 * 4 Save and switch back from XCode to Xamarin Studio to have the AuctionView.cs and AuctionView.designer.cs files generated.
 * 5 Copy and paste the complete code below over the content in the generated AuctionView.cs file.
 * 6 Review the generated NavigateToAuctionView method in your CloudAuctionNavigator class to see
 *   if it uses the navigation method that you intend (segue / push / ...).
 * 7 Delete this AuctionView.TODO.cs file.
